# Description of Work (10 points)

This is new for Project 1. We ask you to include a file called `README.md` that contains a quick description of:

1. the design choices you made,
2. any problems you encountered while creating your solution, and
3. your solutions to those problems.

This is not meant to be comprehensive; less than 300 words will suffice.

2. For the longest time I actually was getting 60-80 / 90 points in the autograder and I had no clue why. Turns out I forgot to convert from Big Endian while receiving the data that led to some data being misinterpreted at different times in the autograder which led to a lower score than what I should've gotten.
